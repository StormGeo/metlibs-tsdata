#   METNO_CHECK_HEADERS([HEADER-FILE...], 
#                       [ACTION-IF-FOUND], [ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND],
#                       [INCLUDES], [CPPFLAGS = $CPPFLAGS], [DESCRIPTION])

#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   METNO_CHECK_HEADERS is an alternative to AC_CHECK_HEADERS that
#   allows specification of CPPFLAGS, to check for headerfiles with a
#   context as specified by e.g. pkg-config.  METNO_CHECK_HEADERS does
#   not permanently change CPPFLAGS.
#
#   METNO_CHECK_LIB is an alternative to AC_CHECK_LIB that allows
#   specification of LIBS, to check for a library within a context as
#   specified by e.g. pkg-config.  As opposed to AC_CHECK_LIB,
#   METNO_CHECK_LIB does not permanently change LIBS.
